# Introduction

Our project is to make a 3D horror-themed game in Unity. Our goal is to make a thrilling game where the player must escape a haunted house, completing various tasks on the way. Players will face enemies and a variety of spooky rooms before they are able to achieve this goal. As the player explores the house, the rooms change and relocate to disorient the player and reveal new secrets. 
  
The enemy that the player must run from stops at the light of a flashlight while any break in sight will cause the enemy to come closer to the player, ultimately killing the player and ending the game. The player will find batteries around the map for their flashlight while also looking around for a way out of the house. They must complete <INSERT TASK HERE> to escape. 


# Anticipated Technologies

* Unity
* Visual Studio
* Github
* Blender


# Method/Approach

We will create tasks for each week and we will all specialize in certain roles. This would be most like the agile method. Our goal is to get a working game and then add more features from there. 

# Estimated Timeline

* October 2: Become familiar enough with Unity to start making game
* October 9: Character Controller
* October 11: Have 3D environment prototype (basic rooms)
* October 16: prototype assets
* Late October: Room moving working prototype
* 1-2 weeks (Late November): Final Changes to game/Bug Fixes/Finish up
* December: Have project that is ready to be turned in


# Anticipated Problems

* Our lack of experience with Unity
* Learning to work remotely
* Merge conflicts
* Lack of experience with C#
